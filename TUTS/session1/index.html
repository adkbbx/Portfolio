    <h1>How do you define nature?</h1>
    <p>
    
        According to The Merriam-Webster Dictionary,
        nature is “a creative and controlling force in         
        the universe,” “the external world in its         
        entirety” or “humankind’s original condition.”         
        The New Oxford American Dictionary describes         
        nature as “the phenomena of the physical world         
        collectively, including plants, animals, the         
        landscape, and other features and products of         
        the earth, as opposed to humans or human         
        creations”; “the basic or inherent features         
        of something, especially when seen as
        characteristic of it”; or “the innate or         
        essential qualities or character of a person         
        or animal.”
